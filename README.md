## Description

This application was created as part of a UT Full Stack Coding Bootcamp challenge. I modified starter code to create a professional README generator. The generator collects user input and creates a README markdown file including: description, license badge, installation, usage, license link, contributing, tests, and questions.

Watch a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sNYA5YKhCqttrKqfAqJYAAIw1JG5mzuJ/view?usp=sharing) demonstration of the basic functionality:
