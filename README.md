# README Generator
## Description
This application was created as part of a UT Full Stack Coding Bootcamp challenge. I modified starter code to create a professional README generator. The generator collects user input and creates a README markdown file including: description, license badge, installation, usage, license link, contributing, tests, and questions.

Watch a video demonstration of the basic functionality:

## Installation
Check if you have Node.js installed by typing "node -v" in your command line. If node is not installed, visit the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en) to install. Next, clone this project repository to your computer.  

## Usage
Change directories to your new project folder in the terminal. Run the application by typing "node index.js" in the terminal's command line. Refer back to the video posted in the description as needed.

## Contributing
[Starter code](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma) was provided by Xander Rapstine ([Xandromus](https://github.com/Xandromus)) and Grace Choi ([gachoi06](https://github.com/gachoi06)).

## Tests
In the demonstration video, the case of 'no license selected by user' was tested. The result was licenses was not listed in the README table of contents and no h2 section for licenses was created.
